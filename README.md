    # For most leaving this as default should be fine, but if you have any issues with -4 cache responses you may wish to increase this gradually
    CACHE_RESPONSE=10 

    # The amount of chain report crontabs to run 
    CHAIN_REPORT = 1

    # The amount of attack report crontabs to run

## Running YATA

To emulate cron activity _dev_cron.py_ can be run as a seperate process. Cron jobs designed to run on a per minute basis will be run as such. Cron's with a longer delay will run on a 30 minute schedule.

    python dev_cron.py

To launch the application simple start the Django Application

    python manage.py runserver

The admin interface can be accessed via

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
    Username: admin
    Password: adminpass
