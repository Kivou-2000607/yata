<h3>Awards Tracker</h3>
<p>All awards data are updated upon refresh of the page.<br />
If you put your cursor hover the last column, you'll have an explanation.<br />
You can show the acheived awards by clicking on the top right section title.<br />
The Hall of Fame rarity score \(R\) is computed as follow:
$$R = {\sum_{a\in\mathcal{P}}r(a)} \ \Big/ \ {\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}r(a)}$$
with \(n(a)\), the number of player having the award \(a\)</li>, \(r(a)=1/\ln(n(a)+1)\) the rarity score of award \(a\), \(\mathcal{A}\) the set of all reachable awards, \(\mathcal{P}\subset\mathcal{A}\) the set of all the awards you have.<br />
If you put your cursor hover the column rarity you'll have the contribution of each honor to this score.<br />
HoF is updated daily and considers only players who went to the Awards Tracker page.</p>

<p>For the devs, a honors dictionary linking API and banner IDs can be found <a href="https://yata.yt/static/honors/bannersId" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
After a tedious work for the initial banners, when in need I take the image id from <a href="https://www.tornstats.com/awards.php" target="_blank">Torn Stats</a>. {{"IceBlueFire"|playerURL:776|safe}} is updating them at an amazing speed, thanks.</p>
