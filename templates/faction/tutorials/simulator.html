            To do a simulation, modify the <b>order</b> of a branch or the <b>level</b> of an upgrade in the table above by clicking on the corresponding number (available modifications are in bold).<br>
            Colored numbers will show you the difference between the current state and the simulation.
        <ul>
            <li>If you modify the <b>order</b> of an upgrade, the whole branch order will be modified and, if needed, the order of another branches will be changed to avoid identical orders.</li>
            <li>If you modify the <b>level</b> of an upgrade, the order of all the branches will be modified to <span class="valid">minimize the respect used</span> and, if needed, the levels of other upgrades of the branch will be <span class="valid">set to their minimal required values</span>.</li>
            <li><b>Challenges</b> are not taken into account for the simulation. You can see the availability of the upgrade levels by clicking on the upgrade name.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><i class="fas fa-toilet-paper fa-icon-inline"></i>You can reset to simulation to the current state by clicking on the reset button on the top right.

        <p><span class="warning">Warning:</span> the simulations are saved on the fly for the faction (not for a member). Modifications of the upgrades by two members at the same time can lead to strange behaviors!</p>
