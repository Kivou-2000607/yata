<h2 class="title"><i class="fas fa-code-branch fa-icon-inline"></i>Open source</h2>
<div class="module">
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/Kivou-2000607/yata-bot" target="_blank">source code</a> of the YATA bot is currently developed and maintained by {{"Kivou"|playerURL:"2000607"|safe}}. Because it is open source, you can encounter different versions controled by different users.</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-check"></i>&nbsp; Official YATA bot</h2>
    <p>The official YATA bot runs on a single server controled by {{"Kivou"|playerURL:"2000607"|safe}} and is hosted on multiple discord servers owned by different users. It uses both Torn API and YATA database.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is the only one that have access to the YATA database</li>
        <li>It is the only one vouched for by {{"Kivou"|playerURL:"2000607"|safe}}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can check if you're dealing with the official bot by checking the list of servers hosting the bot below <b>and</b> by checking that the bot ID is <tt>623862007434706986</tt> (<a href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-" target="_blank">how to look at discord ID</a>).<br>There should be a little tick on the bot badge <img src="/static/images/bot/bot_tick.png" alt="Yata bot verified" height="16px">.</p>
    <h2><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>&nbsp; Unofficial YATA bots</h2>
    <p>There is no control whatsoever on the different versions of the bot. Some might be better, some might be worse, some might be malicious... The only thing known is that they don't have access to the YATA database (and will never have).</p>
