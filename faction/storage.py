from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage
from django.conf import settings
import os

class OverwriteStorage(FileSystemStorage):

    def get_available_name(self, name, max_length=None):
        """Returns a filename that's free on the target storage system, and
        available for new content to be written to.

        This file storage solves overwrite on upload problem. Another
        proposed solution was to override the save method on the model
        like so (from https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/11663):

        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
            try:
                this = MyModelName.objects.get(id=self.id)
                if this.MyImageFieldName != self.MyImageFieldName:
                    this.MyImageFieldName.delete()
            except: pass
            super(MyModelName, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
        """
        # If the filename already exists, remove it as if it was a true file system
        if self.exists(name):
            os.remove(os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, name))
        return name
