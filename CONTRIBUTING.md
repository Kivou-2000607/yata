# Contributing to YATA

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Test your changes
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public Licence

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public Licence](https://github.com/Kivou-2000607/yata/blob/master/LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using YATA's [Discord](https://yata.yt/discord)

We use YATA's discord to track any and all issues

## Write issue reports with detail and background

**Great issue Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough issue reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

YATA's GitHub repo uses [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) to ensure everything remains consistent.

Before making any commits or pull requests we recommend that you enable this in your development environment.

```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
